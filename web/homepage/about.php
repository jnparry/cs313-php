            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have made a hobby out of feeding ducks. Some of my favorite foods are sushi, thai curry, and miso ramen. I used to collect bubble wrap when I was younger, and would ask for rolls of it for Christmas or my birthday. I think cats are awesome and I want one. If I cold have any superpower I would want the ability to read minds, because humans are complex creatures and there's so much more going on everyday than I see and hear. I was born in Japan, but we moved when I was two years old, so I remember nothing of it. I was pretty much raised in Idaho Falls from age six and up. I have a really tall uncle who used to lift us upside-down and into the air so we could walk on the ceiling. I wonder when I got too big to do that anymore.</p>
